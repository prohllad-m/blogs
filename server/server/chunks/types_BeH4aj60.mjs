/**
* Reserved byline-field slugs. Two reasons a slug ends up here:
*
* 1. **Column collision.** Slugs that match a fixed column on
*    `_emdash_bylines` (migrations 031 + 040) would shadow that column
*    on hydration. The first 12 entries cover this.
* 2. **Route collision.** Static file routes under
*    `/_emdash/api/admin/byline-fields/` take precedence over the
*    `[slug].ts` dynamic route in Astro, so a custom field whose slug
*    matches a sibling static file (e.g. `reorder.ts`) is unreachable
*    via single-field CRUD — the static route handles only its own
*    method (POST for `reorder`) and 405s everything else.
*    `reorder` is the only such sibling today; new sibling routes
*    (e.g. a hypothetical `import.ts`) must be added here.
*    `[slug]/usage.ts` lives a level deeper so a slug of `usage` does
*    not collide — it resolves cleanly to `[slug].ts`.
*
* Enforced at the registry layer (Phase 2) and the admin API zod layer
* (Phase 4) so non-HTTP callers (seeds, scripts) get the same guarantee.
