/**
* Global-scope async value cache with single-flight and poison-immunity.
*
* Built for the "compute once for the lifetime of the JS global scope, read
* on every request" caches (site settings, search-health verification, ...).
* That global scope is the process on Node and the isolate on Cloudflare
* Workers — this helper is platform-neutral; the hazard it defends against is
* specific to workerd but the cache itself is not.
*
* These caches must coalesce concurrent cold reads into one query — but the
* obvious way to do that, caching the in-flight *promise* on a global and
* awaiting it from later requests, is unsafe on workerd: if the request that
* created the promise is cancelled mid-await (client disconnect, context
* teardown), its continuation never runs, so the promise neither resolves nor
* rejects. Every later request that awaits that shared promise then hangs
* until the isolate is evicted (observed as 524s at the 100s wall, near-zero
* CPU). A `.catch`/`.finally` that clears the cache doesn't help — a cancelled
* request settles neither way.
*
* This cache stores the resolved *value* (not a promise) and coalesces via
* `initWithLock`: one request becomes the owner and runs `fetch`, everyone
* else polls for the published value and never awaits the owner's promise.
* A cancelled owner can therefore never strand a waiter — the worst case is
* the lock looks held until `deadlineMs`, then the next caller reclaims. The
* owner's `fetch` is also anchored (waitUntil) so a cancelled originator's
* query still completes and populates the cache, and bounded by
* `ownerTimeoutMs` so a genuinely stuck fetch reclaims instead of hanging.
*
* Invalidation bumps `version`; reads compare against the version captured at
* call time and refetch on mismatch.
